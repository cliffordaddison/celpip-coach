## Simple Sentences
A simple sentence contains one independent clause with a subject and predicate.
- Example: "The student studies diligently."

## Compound Sentences
A compound sentence contains two or more independent clauses joined by coordinating conjunctions (and, but, or, so, yet).
- Example: "The student studies diligently, and she practices regularly."

## Complex Sentences
A complex sentence contains one independent clause and at least one dependent clause.
- Example: "Although the student studies diligently, she still needs more practice."

## Compound-Complex Sentences
A compound-complex sentence contains multiple independent clauses and at least one dependent clause.
- Example: "The student studies diligently, and she practices regularly, but she still needs more practice because the exam is challenging."

## Key Points for CELPIP
1. Use varied sentence structures to demonstrate language proficiency
2. Ensure proper punctuation and conjunctions
3. Maintain clarity and logical flow

Sarah: I think social media has both positive and negative effects. On the positive side, it allows us to stay connected with friends and family who live far away. We can share updates and photos instantly.

Professor: That's a good point. What about the negative aspects?

Sarah: Well, some people argue that social media reduces face-to-face communication skills. People might become less comfortable with in-person conversations.

Professor: Excellent observation. Anyone else want to share their perspective?

Mike: I agree with Sarah about the negative effects. I've noticed that some of my friends prefer texting over talking on the phone or meeting in person.

Professor: This is a common concern. However, we should also consider that social media can facilitate meaningful discussions and raise awareness about important issues.`,

Recent studies have shown that employee productivity is significantly influenced by workplace environment and management practices. Companies that invest in creating positive work environments often see improved performance and higher employee satisfaction.

Research indicates that factors such as natural lighting, comfortable seating, and access to green spaces can boost productivity by up to 15%. Additionally, flexible work arrangements and clear communication from management contribute to better employee engagement.

However, the most important factor appears to be employee autonomy. Workers who have control over their schedules and decision-making processes tend to be more productive and innovative. This suggests that micromanagement can actually hinder rather than help productivity.

The study also found that regular feedback and recognition play crucial roles in maintaining high productivity levels. Employees who receive constructive feedback and feel valued are more likely to go above and beyond their basic job requirements.`,
